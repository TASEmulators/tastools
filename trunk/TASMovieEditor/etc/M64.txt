M64 file format description
M64 files consist of a 1024-byte header with various blocks that depend on settings, followed by some input data.

Header format:

    000 4-byte signature: 4D 36 34 1A "M64\x1A"
    004 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: version number, should be 3
    008 4-byte little-endian integer: movie "uid" - identifies the movie-savestate relationship,
               also used as the recording time in Unix epoch format
    00C 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: number of frames (vertical interrupts)
    010 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: rerecord count
    014 1-byte unsigned int: frames (vertical interrupts) per second
    015 1-byte unsigned int: number of controllers
    016 2-byte unsigned int: reserved, should be 0
    018 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: number of input samples for any controllers
    01C 2-byte unsigned int: movie start type
        value 1: movie begins from snapshot (the snapshot will be loaded from an external file
                                             with the movie's filename and a .st extension)
        value 2: movie begins from poweron
        other values: invalid movie
    01E 2-byte unsigned int: reserved, should be 0
    020 4-byte unsigned int: controller flags
        bit 0: controller 1 present
        bit 4: controller 1 has mempak
        bit 8: controller 1 has rumblepak
        +1..3 for controllers 2..4.
    024 160 bytes: reserved, should be 0
    0C4 32-byte ASCII string: internal name of ROM used when recording, directly from ROM
    0E4 4-byte unsigned int: CRC32 of ROM used when recording, directly from ROM
    0E8 2-byte unsigned int: country code of ROM used when recording, directly from ROM
    0EA 56 bytes: reserved, should be 0
    122 64-byte ASCII string: name of video plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
    162 64-byte ASCII string: name of sound plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
    1A2 64-byte ASCII string: name of input plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
    1E2 64-byte ASCII string: name of rsp plugin used when recording, directly from plugin
    222 222-byte UTF-8 string: author's name info
    300 256-byte UTF-8 string: author's movie description info

After the header, starting at byte 0x400 in the file, comes the input data. (NOTE: If the version number at 0x004 is 1 or 2, then the input data starts at byte 0x200 instead.) The input data is a stream of 4-byte bitvectors which indicate which buttons and/or analog directions are pressed at each point in time.

They will come in groups of however many controllers the game happens to check (note that it will never check disabled/disconnected controllers), in whatever order the game happens to check them. There is absolutely no way to correlate the amount of input data with the length of the movie, because the N64 may check input many times in 1 frame or it may not check any input at all for a large number of frames, or anything in-between.

The meaning of each 4-byte value is determined by OR-ing together values for whichever of the following are pressed:

   0x0001     Digital Pad Right
   0x0002     Digital Pad Left
   0x0004     Digital Pad Down
   0x0008     Digital Pad Up
   0x0010     Start
   0x0020     Z
   0x0040     B
   0x0080     A
   0x0100     C-Right
   0x0200     C-Left
   0x0400     C-Down
   0x0800     C-Up
   0x1000     R
   0x2000     L
   0x4000     (unused/reserved)
   0x8000     (unused/reserved)
   0x00FF0000 Analog X (shift right 16 bits and interpret as signed 1-byte integer) (right is positive)
   0xFF000000 Analog Y (shift right 24 bits and interpret as signed 1-byte integer) (up is positive)
